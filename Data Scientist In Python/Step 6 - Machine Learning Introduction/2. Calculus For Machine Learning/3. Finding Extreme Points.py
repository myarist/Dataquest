x = np.linspace(-5,6,110)
y = -2*x +3
plt.plot(x,y)

## 6. Power Rule ##

derivative_one = "5x^4"
derivative_two = "9x^8"
slope_one = 80
slope_two = 0

## 7. Linearity Of Differentiation ##

derivative_three = "5x^4 - 1"
derivative_four = "3x^2 - 2x"
slope_three = 4
slope_four = 8

## 8. Practicing Finding Extreme Values ##

derivative = "3x^2 - 2x"
critical_points = [0, 2/3]
rel_min = [2/3]
rel_max = [0]
